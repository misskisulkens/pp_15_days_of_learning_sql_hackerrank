## Solving the HackerRank Challenge (SQL)

Hi all, another simple project that I've decided to complete - a HackerRank challenge to refresh my SQL skills. All **details** can be found in the **description of the uploaded files** _(there are not a lot of them, I promise)_. I've also made sure to include enough comments in the SQL code itself. Since it's great to hear it a hundred times, but it's better to see it once :)
